"""German Adverb Domain Model.

This module contains the domain model for German adverbs with specialized logic for
German language learning applications. The module is responsible for:

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
    - Modeling German adverb data (word, English translation, type, example)
    - Implementing MediaGenerationCapable protocol for media enrichment
    - Providing German-specific linguistic validation and type classification
    - Contributing domain expertise for image search term generation
    - Supporting audio generation with proper pronunciation context

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
    - Domain model is SMART: Contains German adverb expertise and linguistic knowledge
    - Services are DUMB: External services receive rich context, no domain logic
    - Single Responsibility: Adverb logic stays in Adverb model, not in services
    - Dependency Injection: Protocol-based design for loose coupling

GERMAN LINGUISTIC FEATURES:
    - 9 adverb types with German classifications (Ortsadverb, Zeitadverb, etc.)
    - Type-specific visualization strategies for abstract adverbial concepts
    - Context-aware search term generation using linguistic domain knowledge
    - Support for both German and English type naming for compatibility

INTEGRATION POINTS:
    - MediaGenerationCapable protocol for image/audio media enrichment
    - AnthropicServiceProtocol for AI-powered search term generation
    - MediaEnricher service for coordinated media asset generation

Usage:
    Basic usage:
        >>> adverb = Adverb(
        ...     word="heute",
        ...     english="today",
        ...     type=AdverbType.TIME,
        ...     example="Heute ist schönes Wetter."
        ... )

    Media generation with dependency injection:
        >>> strategy = adverb.get_image_search_strategy(ai_service)
        >>> search_terms = strategy()  # Returns context-aware search terms
        >>> audio_text = adverb.get_combined_audio_text()  # Combined text
