"""German Phrase Domain Model.

This module contains the domain model for German phrases with specialized logic for
German language learning applications. The module is responsible for:

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
    - Modeling German phrase data (phrase, English, context, related phrases)
    - Implementing MediaGenerationCapable protocol for media enrichment
    - Providing German-specific linguistic validation and phrase categorization
    - Contributing domain expertise for image search term generation
    - Supporting audio generation with proper German phrase pronunciation

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
    - Domain model is SMART: Contains German phrase expertise and linguistic knowledge
    - Services are DUMB: External services receive rich context, no domain logic
    - Single Responsibility: Phrase logic stays in Phrase model, not in services
    - Dependency Injection: Protocol-based design for loose coupling

GERMAN LINGUISTIC FEATURES:
    - Phrase categorization system (greetings, farewells, formal, informal, general)
    - Context-aware usage patterns and social register
    - Situational appropriateness guidance for German conversation
    - Context-driven search term generation using communicative scenarios
    - Audio generation with natural German phrase intonation

INTEGRATION POINTS:
    - MediaGenerationCapable protocol for image/audio media enrichment
    - AnthropicServiceProtocol for AI-powered search term generation
    - MediaEnricher service for coordinated media asset generation

Usage:
    Basic usage:
        >>> phrase = Phrase(
        ...     phrase="Guten Morgen!",
        ...     english="Good morning!",
        ...     context="formal greeting used until about 10 AM",
        ...     related="Guten Tag, Guten Abend"
        ... )

    Media generation with dependency injection:
        >>> strategy = phrase.get_image_search_strategy(ai_service)
        >>> search_terms = strategy()  # Returns context-aware search terms
        >>> audio_text = phrase.get_combined_audio_text()  # German phrase audio

    """German phrase domain model with linguistic expertise and media generation.

    Represents a German phrase with its properties, German linguistic knowledge,
    and specialized logic for media enrichment. German phrases are characterized
    by their communicative function, social register (formal/informal), and
    situational appropriateness in German conversation.

    This model implements MediaGenerationCapable protocol to contribute domain
    expertise for image and audio generation, using situational strategies
    for phrase concept visualization and natural German pronunciation.

        related: Related phrases or expressions with similar usage

    Note:
        This model follows the design principle that domain models are SMART
