"""Custom exceptions for langlearn.

This module defines the exception hierarchy for the project.

Exception Categories:
    - Configuration: Missing or invalid configuration
    - Service: External service failures
    - Domain: Language-specific rule violations
    - Data Processing: CSV and record processing errors
    - Card Generation: Template and field mapping errors

All exceptions inherit from LangLearnError for easy catching of
project-specific errors while maintaining specific error types
for proper handling.
"""
